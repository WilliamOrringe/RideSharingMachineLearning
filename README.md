# RideSharingMachineLearning
Ride-sharing is a fast growing industry and the pressure to increase profits and increase customer satisfaction is high for many top ride-sharing customers. The main way they can increase both of these is by getting a driver to a rider more efficiently. In this project I aim to find an optimal approach to this task using Reinforcement Learning.
